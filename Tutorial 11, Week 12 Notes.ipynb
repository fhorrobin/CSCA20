    "\n",
    "#### Practice writing code on pen and paper. It is much different than on a computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "####  Don't memorize how to write specific functions. Instead, understand what the tools we use mean and how to use them.\n",
    "\n",
    "####  Think simple. The exam questions will not require complicated methods. The basics I went over today will be most of what you need.\n",
    "\n",
    "####  Read the instructions carefully! Computers are very specific. And there will almost certainly be little details that if skimemd by without attention will lead to programs that don't behave as expected. \n",
    "\n",
    "####  If you don't understand the wording of a question, ask. Someone else probably has the same question and as long as we are not giving you the answer, we can help expain what the question is asking. Especially true if you just don't understand a non-technical word or find the grammar confusing.\n",
    "\n",
    "####  You will be given a list of some helpful methods (see last year's exam) use it when needed but don't rely on it too much. You don't want to waste time looking though it. Try familiarizing yourself with it ahead of time so that you at least have an idea of what you need without having to search through it.\n",
    "\n",
    "####  Practice reading other people's code. There will be questions on descirbing what a code does and reading other code is also good practice for writing better code yourself.\n",
    "\n",
    "####  There are lots of questions and they ask for a variety of different types of work. Do the questions you find easiest well first and then come back to the difficult ones. Manage the time well and rememeber that it is better to leave a small question blank than run out of time because you got stuck on it.\n",
